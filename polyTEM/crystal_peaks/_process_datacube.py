    """
    Finds peak position of I vs. theta lineouts at each datacube gridpoint. Returns peaks matrix with ones in
    locations where a peak was found. Function uses a user-defined threshold function.
    
    :param data: datacube numpy array of size (n_rows, n_cols, n_angles=180)
    :param threshold_function: Required threshold of peaks, the vertical distance to its neighbouring samples.
    More info at https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.find_peaks.html
    :param distance: Required minimal horizontal distance (>= 1) in samples between neighbouring peaks.
    More info at https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.find_peaks.html
    :param width: Required width of peaks in samples.
    More info at https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.find_peaks.html
    :param plot_freq: frequency at which to plot as examples the I vs. theta lineouts and resulting peak finding
    :return: peaks_matrix: 3D numpy array of same shape as datacube with ones in angular values at every grid point
    where a peak was found, and zeroes elsewhere.
