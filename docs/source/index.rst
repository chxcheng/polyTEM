polyTEM
===================================

**polyTEM**is a Python library for analyzing HRTEM images of polymeric materials. 
polyTEM handles CTF correct, image frame drift correction, backbone chain orientation, 
domain clustering, and statistical analysis of 2D images.


.. note::

   This project is under active development. Documentation is publicly
   available to demonstrate the working applications of this package. 
   Version-controlled source code will be released as manuscripts are published.
