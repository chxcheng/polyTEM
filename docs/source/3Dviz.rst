Interactive visualization
---------------------------

The embedded visualization may take up to 2 minutes to load. 
The plot is rendered using plotly backend. The buttons on the left side
represent the set of streamtubes that were initalized at the y_value
labelled, and each set of streamtubes are coloured respectively. Clicking the
button will toggle the visibility of the streamtubes, but may take up to 30 seconds
for the plotly.js backend to reload. Performance speedups will be included
in future versions.
